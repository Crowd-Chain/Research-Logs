A new approach to crowd journalism using a blockchain-based infrastructure (Leonardo Teixeira, Ivone Amorim, Alexandre Ulisses Silva)


	Permissioned blockchain:
	"The intrinsic configuration of such blockchains controls the participants' transactions and defines their roles in which each participant can access and contribute to the                            blockchain.  
	Maintain an access control layer to allow certain actions to be performed only by certain identifiable participants.
	They are crafted to take advantage of blockchains without sacrificing the authority aspect of a centralized system."

	"Proof ofWork (PoW) is the lottery-based algorithm
	used by the Bitcoin blockchain network and it is based on the
	premise that a node must use computational power to prove that
	it has no malicious intent to tamper with the network. On the
	other hand, the Proof of Stake (PoS) stands out for its absence of
	complicated and expensive calculations. This method states that
	participants who have more digital assets of the cryptocurrency
	would be less likely to act maliciously on the network and so they
	are more likely to be chosen to forge the new block. Along with
	these two, there are many other lottery-based algorithms to define
	a network consensus (Proof of Authority (PoA), Proof of Elapsed
	Time (PoET), Proof of Burn (PoB), etc.)."





AI Blockchain Platform for Trusting News(Zonyin Shae, Jeffrey J.P. Tsai)


	"In our model as shown in Figure 4, the news propagates
	among news consumers (general population), social media,
	and press media. Each news propagate from one entity to
	other entity will be recorded as a transaction in the blockchain
	ledger."


	"Our system model consists a “factual database” as a root
	of blockchain data architecture for us to trace back during the
	process of analyzing, tracing, and ranking the news. This
	factual database, in which all records are considered factual,
	provides the ground truth and corner stone for our system.
	News in the Internet will be divided into two groups: one
	group is able to trace back to the factual database in the news
	blockchain supply chain graph, and the other group cannot
	(that is, this group can only be traced back into some unverified
	news data sources)."
	
	
	"The factual database needs to be built from all the factual
	news. This is a critically important and quite a challenging
	task. We propose that, at the beginning, the database only
	consists of the facts which we can take it for granted as fact in
	nature and do not need any tool or person to verify. Some of
	the factual news data sources that we currently consider are,
	for examples, the library of speech records of law makers, and
	the official speech records of presidents and public figures.
	The information in these public records considered above
	should have been officially validated as facts and can be used
	to provide a basis of ground truth of facts."

	"If the news is
	verified to be factual, then it can be added into the factual
	database as well."
